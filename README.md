🌞 Shamsak – Solar Services Platform
Shamsak is a bilingual web platform (Arabic & English) that connects homeowners and small businesses in Saudi Arabia with certified technicians for solar panel installation and maintenance.

🔧 What the project solves:
Many people want to install solar panels but face difficulty finding trusted, certified technicians. Shamsak bridges this gap by allowing users to easily request services and get matched with providers in their area.

🛠️ How it was built:
I started the project through the Replit course provided to me, where I learned the fundamentals of building web apps.

I chose the solar energy topic and used the Etlaq platform to explore branding, user experience, and market fit.

The MVP was developed on Replit, starting with a free version, then upgraded to a paid plan to unlock full features.

The platform includes user roles for both clients and technicians, basic form submissions, and connected backend logic.

I faced some challenges like Arabic translation and dynamic page routing, but I worked through them and built a solid web app.

Payment is not integrated yet — users currently pay in cash or by card at service delivery. Online payment may be added later.

This was a new and exciting experience where I gained hands-on skills in a short time, and I look forward to improving and expanding this project further.
